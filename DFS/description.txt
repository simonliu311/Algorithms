Question specification:
input format -> first line: #vertices, #edges
                subsequent lines: pairs of numbers, outlining directed edges
output format -> in each line, a pair of numbers indicating a directed edge between two vertices
                and a label for each edge:
                tree edge: an edge (u, v) is a tree edge if it is the edge you are traversing
                            when visiting v for the first time in the algorithm
                forward edge: an edge (u, v) is a forward edge if v is a descendant of u
                            in the DFS forest, but (u, v) is not a tree edge
                back edge: an edge (u, v) is a back edge if v is an ancestor of u
                            in the DFS forest
                cross edge: an edge (u, v) is a cross edge in all other cases, i.e.
                            if there is no path of tree edges u -> v nor v -> u

I chose to implement an algorithmic solution to this problem using recursion, in Python.
